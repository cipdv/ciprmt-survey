            feels intimadated by yoga classes because they feel inflexible and
            unable to get into the postures required in the class. These classes
            would focus on teaching yoga postures in a more relaxed and less
            intimidating environment.

            I have always tried to keep my rates low, and Iâ€™ll continue to keep
            them low. Since beginning my massage practice I have absorbed the
            cost of HST, but with rising costs, I do feel the need to raise my
            rates for 2024, but I would still like to maintain my rates below
            the average recommended massage rates for the area so that my
            massage services are accessible to most people. This is what I am
            proposing for July 2024:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-4">
            <li>$70 +HST for 30 minutes ($79.10)</li>
            <li>$115 +HST for 60 minutes ($129.95)</li>
            <li>$135 +HST for 75 minutes ($152.55)</li>
            <li>$155 +HST for 90 minutes ($175.15)</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Please let me know how these rates will affect your ability to
            receive massage from me:
